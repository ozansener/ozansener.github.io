 Worked on the geometrical understanding of deep learning architectures. Studied the geometry of feature spaces learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which resulted in a theoretical understanding of generalization properties of CNNs \emph{in Submission}. Further extended these results to transfer learning problems and developed a domain adaptation \emph{(in NIPS 2016)} and active learning algorithm \emph{(in Submission)} with theoretical guarantees.
