Worked on large-scale machine learning algorithms for computer vision.

\newpage

Developed a transductive machine learning algorithm for unsupervised domain adaptation problem. The resulting algorithm enables machine learning models to be trained on one domain and used in other ones \emph{(in NIPS 2016)}.

  Developed a structured parsing algorithm which can parse large point clouds of buildings into its semantic elements near real time. \emph{(in CVPR 2016)}.

  Developed a large-scale, unsupervised video understanding framework using category specific youtube videos. The resulting algorithm can parse large collection of videos by discovering the underlying activities. \emph{(in ICCV 2015)}.
