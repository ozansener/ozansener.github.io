Worked on machine learnings which goes beyond supervised learning using smart teachers. Developed a Bayesian deep learning method which can utilize any privileged information while training an arbitrary neural network. Theoretically showed that it is possible to learn with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ rate (in generalization error sense) using privileged information in oracle sense. \emph{(in CVPR 2018)}. 

Developed a multi-objective optimization based method for multi-task learning. The resulting method provably finds a Pareto optimal point of given tasks \emph{(in Submission)}.

Developed a domain generalisation method using distributionally robust optimization. The proposed method learns an ensemble of models such that each correspond to different bias variance trade-off. In test time, the developed method selects and uses the right bias-variance trade-off \emph{(in Submission)}.
