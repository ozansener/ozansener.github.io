Studied graphical models from an efficiency perspective. Developed a geometric framework for efficient and explicit approximations of probability distributions over high dimensional spaces. Using the developed geometric understanding, proposed a novel inference mechanism -rCRF- in order to efficiently, accurately and explicitly represent a belief over any CRF model using structured diversity \emph{(in RSS 2015 and an invited talk at AAAI 2016)}. Further extended the developed geometric approach to efficient learning algorithm for graphical models with hidden nodes and non-parametric priors \emph{(in the process of submission)}.

Designed a large-scale multi-modal processing and storage system which scales to millions of videos, images and text as a part of the RoboBrain (\emph{www.robobrain.me}) project \emph{(in ISRR 2015)}.
