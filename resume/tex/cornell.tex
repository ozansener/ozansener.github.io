  Advised by Prof. Ashutosh Saxena.

Worked on large-scale machine learning algorithms with limited supervision for robotics applications. 

Developed a large-scale, unsupervised video understanding framework. The resulting algorithm can parse a large collection of videos by discovering the underlying activities. \emph{(in ICCV 2015, and ISRR 2015)}.

Studied graphical models from an efficiency perspective. Developed a geometric framework for efficient approximations of probability distributions over high dimensional spaces using structured diversity \emph{(in RSS 2015)}.
