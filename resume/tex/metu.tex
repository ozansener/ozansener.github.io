	%Advised by Prof. Ayd\i n Alatan (METU) and Dr. Kemal Ugur (Nokia Research Center, Tampere).

	Developed an efficient interactive video segmentation algorithm via Markov random field energy propagation. Proposed a dynamic method to reuse residual-flows in filtering scenario for time efficiency \emph{(in Transaction on Multimedia 2013)}. Further improved the robustness of the method via automatic correction of user interaction errors \emph{(in ACM-MM-W 2012, ICIP 2012)}.
	
	Involved in patent application and deployed part of the developed algorithms to production on Nokia N9.
