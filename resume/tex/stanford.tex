Developed a structured parsing algorithm which can parse large point clouds of buildings into its semantic elements near real time. \emph{(in CVPR 2016)}.

Developed a large-scale, unsupervised video understanding framework using category specific youtube videos. The resulting algorithm can parse large collection of videos by discovering the underlying activities. \emph{(in ICCV 2015)}.

 Worked on the geometrical understanding of deep learning architectures. Studied the geometry of feature spaces learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which resulted in a theoretical understanding of generalization properties of CNNs \emph{in ICLR 2018}. Further extended these results to transfer learning problems and developed a domain adaptation \emph{(in NIPS 2016)} and active learning algorithm \emph{(in ICLR 2018)} with theoretical guarantees.
