 Advised by Prof. Silvio Savarese.

Studied the geometry of feature spaces learned by convolutional neural networks. Further extended these results to transfer learning problems and developed a domain adaptation \emph{(in NeurIPS 2016)} and active learning algorithm \emph{(in ICLR 2018)} with theoretical guarantees.

Developed a structured parsing algorithm that can parse large point clouds of buildings into its semantic elements near real-time \emph{(in CVPR 2016)}.

Advised two master students on the topics of domain generalization using distributionally robust optimization \emph{(in NeurIPS 2018)}, and deep learning using privileged information \emph{(in CVPR 2018)}.
