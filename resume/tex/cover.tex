 \section{\mysidestyle \textcolor{olgray}{Interest}}
Broadly, I am interested in designing machine learning algorithms which can process large-amount of multi-modal information with no/weak supervision.  I have designed algorithms which scaled to tens of thousands of videos, point clouds with hundreds of millions of points and deployed them in robots, mobile devices and homes. I mostly worked on classification/parsing/segmentation problems in robot perception and mobile multimedia, using graphical models, metric learning and deep learning. In general, I am interested in any problem related to machine learning and large-scale data.
