 \section{\mysidestyle \textcolor{olgray}{Interest}}
Broadly, I am interested in designing machine learning algorithms that can process large-scale information in a sample-efficient way.  
I like to work in the intersection of theory and applied research, where I aim to develop large-scale engineering systems with a solid theoretical grounding and develop a theory to understand these systems better. I have developed various machine learning methods for transfer learning problems like domain generalization, multi-task learning, active learning, and meta-learning.
