I am a PhD student at [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](http://ece.cornell.edu/) of [Cornell University](http://cornell.edu) working with [Ashutosh Saxena](http://cs.cornell.edu/~asaxena/). I recently moved to [Stanford AI Lab](http://ai.stanford.edu/) as a visiting PhD student. I am interested in machine learning and its applications in computer vision and robotics. Specifically, I am interested in understanding humans through language and visual information.

Before Cornell and Stanford, I completed my M.Sc. study at Multimedia Research Group led by [Aydin Alatan](http://eee.metu.edu.tr/~alatan/) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering department of [METU](http://metu.edu.tr).

When I am not doing research or writing code, I am mostly reading some science-fiction books or practicing juggling. I usually spend quite a bit time on juggling, especially diabolo and club tricks. I am also interested in designing and playing puzzles and team games.

If you want/need to contact me, the fastest option is usually an e-mail. My e-mail address is os79\[at\]cornell\[dot\]edu.
