        Easiest way to contact me is e-mail. However, If you need to meet me in person, you can probably find me doing research in Gates Hall, drinking cofee at Stella's, or juggling at art's quad.

        Feel free to contact me anyway you like if you have questions/suggestions about my work or just want to discuss anything about machine learning, probability, robotics, mathmetics, juggling, sci-fi or any nerdy topic you can imagine.
