        Easiest way to contact me is in general e-mail. If you need to meet me in person, you can probably find me doing research in Gates Hall 325, drinking cofee at Stella's, juggling at Art's Quad or Procrastinating at the garden of the Big Red Barn.

        Feel free to contact me anyway you like if you have questions/suggestions about my work or just want to discuss anything about machine learning, probability, robotics, mathmetics, juggling, sci-fi or any nerdy topic you can imagine. At the end of the page you can also find links to my social media spots and my code repositories.
